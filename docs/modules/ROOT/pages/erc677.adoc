=  ERC677

== Introduction to ERC677

ERC-677 is an Ethereum token standard designed to streamline token interactions with smart contracts. Unlike ERC-20, it includes a 'transferAndCall' function. This enables token transfers to directly trigger actions within the recipient contract (a callback), enhancing automation potential.

== Key Components of ERC677

1. *Transfer and Call*: This is an essential function in the ERC-677 standard known as 'transferAndCall'. It enhances the basic transfer functionality from ERC-20, allowing more intricate interactions. Upon transferring tokens, 'transferAndCall' automatically initiates a callback in the receiving smart contract, given the contract is designed to accommodate it.

2. *ERC677Receiver*: For a smart contract to be compatible with ERC-677 transfers, it has to implement the ERC677Receiver protocol. This encompasses a sole function titled 'onTokenTransfer', serving as the defined callback. Consequently, it enables the contract to run custom logic whenever it obtains ERC-677 tokens.

Please note, specifics of the key components and connected functions may vary depending on the specific requirements of your project's implementation.

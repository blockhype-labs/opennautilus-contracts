=  Tokens

Tokens, within blockchain systems, are programmable units that represent digital assets. These assets can embody ownership of digital objects, access rights within a system, or the logic of a smart contract.  Tokens are foundational elements within blockchain applications.

== Standards

* xref:erc20.adoc[ERC20]  is Ethereum's popular technical standard for implementing tokens. It includes a set of predefined rules that all new tokens based on the Ethereum blockchain must implement, such as balanceOf, transfer, transferFrom, approve, and allowance.

* xref:erc677.adoc[ERC677] is a chain-specific token standard in the Ethereum blockchain. It is an extension of the ERC20 standard, introducing a `transferAndCall` method which allows tokens to be transferred and a call to be made to the receiving contract in a single transaction.

== Ethereum Request for Comments (ERC) Standards

* *xref:erc20.adoc[ERC20]:* ERC20 is the foundational standard for fungible tokens on Ethereum blockchain. It establishes a common list of rules for all Ethereum tokens to adhere to, allowing developers to accurately predict the interaction between tokens. These rules comprise six crucial functions: totalSupply, balanceOf, transfer, transferFrom, approve, and allowance.

* *xref:erc721.adoc[ERC721]:* ERC721 implemented a standard for non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on the Ethereum blockchain. Unlike ERC20 tokens which all have the same value, each ERC721 token possesses a unique value. Beyond standard functions for maintaining ownership records and facilitating token transfer, ERC721 also introduces a secure operators feature. This allows secure, authorized transfers and reduces the risk of tokens getting stuck in unprepared contracts. ERC721 also encourages optional metadata extensions for adding extra token information.

* *xref:erc677.adoc[ERC677]:* ERC677 is an extension to the ERC20 standard that introduces a new function called `transferAndCall`. This functionality allows tokens to be transferred and a callback to be executed in a single transaction. This results in more efficient token transfers when interacting with smart contract functions. For compatibility, smart contracts must implement a 'tokenFallback' function to handle incoming ERC677 token transfers.

It's important to note that even though these standards guide the behavior of tokens on the Ethereum network, the final implementations and functionalities may vary based on the specific use-case or the decisions of the developers.

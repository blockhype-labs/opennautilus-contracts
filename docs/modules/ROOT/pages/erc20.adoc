=  ERC20

== Introduction to ERC20

ERC-20 tokens are digital assets native to the Ethereum blockchain that adhere to a common set of rules. This standardization ensures predictability and compatibility across dApps, exchanges, and wallets within the Ethereum network.

== Key Components of ERC20

1. *Total Supply*: The 'totalSupply' method provides the overall amount of tokens in existence.

2. *Ownership*: The 'balanceOf' function allows users to check the balance of tokens associated with a particular address.

3. *Direct Transfer*: 'transfer' method enables token owners to directly transfer their tokens to other addresses.

4. *Delegated Transfer*: The 'transferFrom' function allows an approved third-party contracts, such as decentralized exchanges, to facilitate token transfers on behalf of the user.

5. *Approvals*: The 'approve' method gives a specific address (spender) the permission to transfer a pre-defined amount of tokens from your account.

6. *Remaining Allowance*: 'allowance' function is used to check the balance of tokens that a spender is still allowed to pull from an owner's account.

Please note that the key components and associated functionality can differ depending on the implementation and the specific requirements of your project.

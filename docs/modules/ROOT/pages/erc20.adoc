=  ERC20

== Introduction to ERC20

ERC-20 tokens are digital assets native to the Ethereum blockchain that adhere to a common set of rules. This standardization ensures predictability and compatibility across dApps, exchanges, and wallets within the Ethereum network.

== Key Components

The ERC-20 protocol mandates the following six core functions:

* totalSupply: Provides the total number of tokens in existence.
* balanceOf: Returns the token balance associated with a specific address.
* transfer: Enables direct token transfers between addresses.
* transferFrom: Allows approved third-party contracts (e.g., decentralized exchanges) to facilitate token transfers on a user's behalf.
* approve: Grants a designated address (spender) permission to transfer a specified amount of tokens from your account.
* allowance: Checks the remaining tokens a spender is authorized to transfer from a particular owner's account.
